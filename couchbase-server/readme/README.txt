COUCHBASE SERVER

Couchbase Server is an open source, distributed NoSQL document
database.  Couchbase Server enables developers to build applications
with agility by combining the flexibility of JSON data with the power
of SQL-like queries, using N1QL, or through built-in full-text search
capabilities.

The platform gives you the flexibility to constantly reinvent the
customer experience, from any cloud to every edge device.  Using
in-memory dataset capabilities, the platform can be scaled to match
needs for volume, volatility, and speed of data.

By providing a flexible data model, consistent high performance,
elastic scalability, and always-on availability, Couchbase Server
enables enterprises to operate at any scale with enterprise-level
security.

Its memory-centric architecture is designed to provide low-latency
data management for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and IoT
applications.

Couchbase Server runs in the cloud or on commodity hardware.

The server automatically starts after installation and the web-based
console is available on port 8091 by default.

Refer to the documentation for setup instructions.


INSTALLATION

Mac OS X has a security policy that requires downloaded software be
installed into the Applications directory. This can be achieved by
copying the Couchbase Server application into that folder before
launching.
