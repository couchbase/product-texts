COUCHBASE SERVER

Couchbase Server is an open source, distributed NoSQL document
database. It exposes a fast key-value store with managed cache
for sub-millisecond data operations, a powerful query engine for
executing SQL queries over JSON data, and purpose-built indexers
for fast queries.

Couchbase Server enables developers to build applications with
agility by combining the flexibility of JSON data with the power
of SQL-like queries, using N1QL, or through built-in full-text
search capabilities.

By providing a flexible data model, consistent high performance,
elastic scalability, and always-on availability, Couchbase Server
enables enterprises to operate at any scale with enterprise-level
security.

Its memory-centric architecture is designed to provide low-latency
data management for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and IoT
applications.

Couchbase Server runs in the cloud or on commodity hardware.

The server automatically starts after installation and the
web-based console is available on port 8091 (default). Refer to
the documentation for setup instructions.


INSTALLATION

Mac OS X has a security policy that requires downloaded
software be installed into the Applications directory. This can
be achieved by copying the Couchbase Server application into that
folder.
