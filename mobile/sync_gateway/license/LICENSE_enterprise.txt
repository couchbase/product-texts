COUCHBASE INC. ENTERPRISE SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE AGREEMENT

IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY:  BY CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BOX OR
INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR OTHERWISE USING THIS SOFTWARE AND ANY
ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION, YOU, ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND AS AN AUTHORIZED
REPRESENTATIVE ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY ("LICENSEE") AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS
OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE "AGREEMENT") REGARDING YOUR AND LICENSEE'S
USE OF THE SOFTWARE. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL LEGAL
AUTHORITY TO BIND THE LICENSEE TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT SELECT THE "I ACCEPT" BOX AND DO NOT
INSTALL, DOWNLOAD OR OTHERWISE USE THE SOFTWARE. THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
THIS AGREEMENT IS THE DATE ON WHICH YOU CLICK "I ACCEPT" OR OTHERWISE
INSTALL, DOWNLOAD OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

1A. License Grant as to Free Licenses. A "Free License" is allowed for
non-production use of the Software, provided that no Support Services
are entitled to Licensee.  During the Subscription Term, and subject to
Licensee's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Couchbase grants to Licensee an unpaid, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, non-fee bearing download license to install and use
the Software only for Licensee's own internal testing and development
use. If, at any time, Licensee uses the Software in production, or if
Licensee requests Support Services, Licensee acknowledges and agrees
that the license is automatically converted to an Enterprise License,
which must be paid for.

1B.  License Grant as to Enterprise Licenses. An "Enterprise License"
is required if Licensee makes any "Productive Use" (which means that
either (a) the Software is used in production, or (b) Support Services
are requested by Licensee). During the Subscription Term, and subject to
Licensee's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Couchbase grants to Licensee either i) a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, fee bearing license to install and use the Software
only for Licensee's own internal use and limited to the number of Licensed
Nodes paid for by Licensee (and if stated in the Order, the number of
Licensed Devices paid for by Licensee).

2. Restrictions.  Licensee will not: (a) copy or use the Software
and Documentation in any manner except as expressly permitted in this
Agreement; (b) use or deploy the Software in excess of the number of
Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices for which Licensee has paid the
applicable Subscription Fee; (c) transfer, sell, rent, lease, lend,
distribute, or sublicense the Software and Documentation to any third
party; (d) use the Software for providing time-sharing services, service
bureau services or as part of an application services provider or as a
service offering primarily designed to offer the functionality of the
Software; (e) reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Software
(except to the extent such restrictions are prohibited by law); (f) alter,
modify, enhance or prepare any derivative work from or of the Software
and Documentation; (g) alter or remove any proprietary notices in the
Software and Documentation; or (h) export the Software in violation of
U.S. Department of Commerce export administration rules or any other
export laws or regulations.  If Licensee does not comply with the license
terms or the foregoing restrictions, Couchbase may (without refund or
credit) terminate Licensee's license to the Software and Documentation
or, at its sole discretion, suspend Licensee's license to the Software
and Documentation until Licensee comes into compliance with such terms
and restrictions.

3. Proprietary Rights.  The Software (and any modifications or derivatives
thereto) and all Documentation and Services, are and shall remain the
sole property of Couchbase and its licensors. Except for the license
rights granted herein, Couchbase and its licensors retain all right,
title and interest in and to the Software, Documentation and Services,
including all intellectual property rights therein and thereto.
The Software may include third party open source software components
and such third party components shall be licensed to Licensee under the
terms of the applicable open source license conditions and/or copyright
notices that can be found in the licenses file, Documentation or materials
accompanying the Software.  If Licensee is the United States Government
or any contractor thereof, all licenses granted hereunder are subject
to the following: (a) for acquisition by or on behalf of civil agencies,
as necessary to obtain protection as "commercial computer software" and
related documentation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
as specified in Subpart 12.1212 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR), 48 C.F.R.12.1212, and its successors; and (b) for acquisition
by or on behalf of the Department of Defense (DOD) and any agencies or
units thereof, as necessary to obtain protection as "commercial computer
software" and related documentation in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and as specified in Subparts 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3
of the DOD FAR Supplement, 48 C.F.R.227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3, and its
successors, Manufacturer is Couchbase, Inc.

4. Support.  This Section applies only to Enterprise Licenses, but not
to Free Licenses. Couchbase offers several levels of Support Services
for the Software. Couchbase will provide Licensee with the level of
Support indicated on the applicable Order and paid for by Licensee. For
all Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices within a specific Production
Deployment, all such nodes and instances must be at the same level of
Support, including any that are used for disaster recovery or backup
that are associated with the specific Production Deployment. For the
avoidance of doubt, each specific Production Deployment can have its own
level of Support.  Similarly, all Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices in
a development or test environment must be at the same level of Support
but such Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices may be at a different
support level than the Production Deployment(s). When using the Cross
Data Center Replication feature, Licensee must have all Licensed Nodes
and Licensed Devices at the same level of Support for all instances on
all sides of the replication connection, including if one side of the
connection is only used for disaster recovery or backup.

5. Payments.  This Section applies only to Enterprise Licenses, but not
to Free Licenses. Licensee will pay Couchbase the Subscription Fees and
any other applicable fees as set forth in each Order.  All payments
shall be made in the currency stated on the Order and are due within
thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice.  Late payments will bear
interest at the lesser of one and one half percent (1  1/2 %) per month
or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law.  In addition, Licensee
will reimburse Couchbase for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) in collecting any overdue amounts.
All fees payable under this Agreement are net amounts and are payable
in full, without deduction for taxes or duties of any kind.  All fees
are exclusive of, and Licensee is responsible for, all duties and
taxes (including Value Added Tax which shall be paid by Licensee, if
applicable, at the rate and in the manner for the time being prescribed
by law), except for taxes based on Couchbase's net income.  All fees
are non-refundable except to the extent expressly provided for in
this Agreement.  If Licensee sends Couchbase a purchase order ("PO"),
the PO will be deemed a binding contract offer which Couchbase may
accept by signing the PO or sending a written order acknowledgment of
acceptance of the PO (thereby forming a mutually agreed Order governed
by this Agreement); in such case the only terms listed on the accepted
PO which will form the Order are the Commercial Details; and all other
terms (whether additional or conflicting with this Agreement) on the
PO will be void and without effect, even if Couchbase signs the PO.
All accepted POs will automatically be governed by this Agreement (even
if the PO does not reference this Agreement).

6. Records Retention and Audit.  Licensee shall maintain complete and
accurate records to permit Couchbase to verify Licensee's compliance
with this Agreement (including the number of Licensed Nodes and
Licensed Devices used by Licensee), and provide Couchbase with such
records within ten (10) days of request.  Upon at least thirty (30)
days prior written notice, Couchbase may audit Licensee's use of the
Software to assess whether Licensee is in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement.  Any such audit will be conducted during regular business
hours at Licensee's facilities and will not unreasonably interfere with
Licensee's business activities.  Licensee will provide Couchbase with
access to the relevant Licensee records and facilities.  If an audit
reveals that Licensee has underpaid fees to Couchbase, then Couchbase
will invoice Licensee, and Licensee will promptly pay Couchbase for such
underpaid fees based on Couchbase's price list in effect at the time
the audit is completed.  If the underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%)
of the Subscription Fee paid by Licensee for the Software, then Licensee
will also pay Couchbase's reasonable costs of conducting the audit.

7. Confidentiality.  Licensee and Couchbase will maintain the
confidentiality of Confidential Information.  The receiving party of
any Confidential Information of the other party agrees not to use such
Confidential Information for any purpose except as necessary to fulfill
its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement.  The
receiving party shall protect the secrecy of and prevent disclosure and
unauthorized use of the disclosing party's Confidential Information using
the same degree of care that it takes to protect its own confidential
information and in no event shall use less than reasonable care.
The terms of this Confidentiality section shall survive termination or
expiration of this Agreement.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the
receiving party will, at the disclosing party's option, promptly return
or destroy (and provide written certification of such destruction) the
disclosing party's Confidential Information.  A party may disclose the
other party's Confidential Information to the extent required by law
or regulation.

8. Disclaimer of Warranty.  THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION AND ANY SERVICES
PROVIDED HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
COUCHBASE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION OR SERVICES
PROVIDED HEREUNDER WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE SOFTWARE
WILL OPERATE IN THE COMBINATIONS LICENSEE MAY SELECT FOR USE, THAT
THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED,
OR THAT ALL SOFTWARE ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, COUCHBASE HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF
DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE. COUCHBASE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS
DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE IN ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING
FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE WHERE THE FAILURE OF THE PRODUCT COULD LEAD TO
DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.

9. Indemnification of Third Party Claims.

9.1 Couchbase Indemnification.  Subject to the terms of this Section
9, Couchbase will indemnify and defend Licensee from and against
any damages finally awarded against Licensee in connection with any
third party claims that the non-open source software components of the
Software, Documentation or Services infringe any United States patent,
or United States copyright, or United States trademark; provided that:
(a) Licensee promptly notifies Couchbase of the claim; (b) Licensee gives
Couchbase all necessary information regarding the claim and reasonably
cooperates with Couchbase; and (c) allows Couchbase exclusive control
of the defense and all related settlement negotiations.

9.2 Licensee Indemnification. Licensee will indemnify and defend
Couchbase from and against any damages finally awarded against Couchbase
in connection with any third party claim that Licensee's use, operation
or combination of the Software, including Licensee's data or content,
infringe any United States patent, United States copyright or United
States trademark or violates this Agreement.

9.3 Injunction.  If use of the Software, Documentation or Services are
enjoined, or Couchbase determines that such use may be enjoined, Couchbase
will, at its sole option and expense, (a) procure for Licensee the right
to continue using the affected Software, Documentation or Services;
(b) replace or modify the affected Software, Documentation or Services
that infringe so that they do not infringe; or (c) if either option (a)
or (b) is not commercially feasible in Couchbase's reasonable opinion,
as applicable, terminate the licenses and affected Services and refund
Licensee a pro-rata amount of the Subscription Fees and fees for the
affected Services.

9.4 Exclusions.  Couchbase will have no liability for any infringement
claim, (A) as to Software and Documentation, (i) based on modifications
to the Software and Documentation made by a party other than Couchbase,
to the extent a claim would not have occurred but for such modifications,

Software provided that Couchbase has given reasonable written notice to
Licensee to migrate to the then-current version of the Software, unless
the infringing portion is also in the then-current, unaltered release,
(iii) based on the use, operation or combination of the Software with
non-Couchbase programs, data, or equipment to the extent such infringement
would have been avoided but for such use, operation or combination,
(iv) attributable to any third party open source software components,
(v) to the extent based on Licensee's use of the Software other than
in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Documentation, (vi)
based on Licensee's continued allegedly infringing activity after being
notified thereof or after being provided a replacement or modifications
by Couchbase that would have avoided the alleged infringement; or
(B) as to Services, (i) based on modifications to the Services made
by a party other than Couchbase, to the extent a claim would not have
occurred but for such modifications, (ii) based on Licensee's use of
the Services in violation of this Agreement, and such use causes such
infringement, (iii) based on infringement resulting from the combination
of the Services, with any hardware, data or software not provided by
Couchbase, (iv) based on Couchbase's compliance with any materials,
designs, specifications or instructions provided by Licensee, or (v)
based on Licensee's continued allegedly infringing activity after being
notified thereof or after being provided a replacement or modifications
by Couchbase that would have avoided the alleged infringement.

9.5 Sole Remedy.  THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION CONSTITUTE THE ENTIRE

a period of time paid for. As to Free Licenses, the Subscription Term
begins on the date of download, and lasts until terminated.  Subject to
Couchbase's rights under Section 2 above, either party may terminate
this Agreement or an Enterprise License prior to the end of a term if
the other party materially breaches its obligations hereunder and, where
such breach is curable, such breach remains uncured for thirty (30) days
following written notice of the breach. Licensee's obligation to make
a payment of any outstanding, unpaid fees shall survive termination

Order, or this Agreement, Licensee will promptly return or destroy

Software and all copies and portions thereof, in all forms and types of
media. As to a Free License, a party may terminate such license at any

OF USE, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS,
LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF AND REGARDLESS OF THE
LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE
CLAIM IS BASED. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO
EVENT WILL COUCHBASE'S OR ITS LICENSORS' AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE,
FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE
TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID BY LICENSEE TO COUCHBASE THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE
ORDER GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY
PRECEDING THE ACT OR OMISSION FIRST GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.
The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that Couchbase has set its
prices and entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the limitations
of liability specified herein, which allocate the risk between Couchbase
and Licensee and form a basis of the bargain between the parties.

12. General.  Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in
performance (except for any payment obligations) due to causes beyond
its reasonable control.  Neither party will, without the other party's
prior written consent, make any news release, public announcement,
denial or confirmation of this Agreement, its value, or its terms and
conditions, or in any manner advertise or publish the fact of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, Couchbase may use Licensee's name
and logo, consistent with Licensee's trademark policies, on customer lists
so long as such use in no way promotes either endorsement or approval of
Couchbase or any Couchbase products or services. Licensee may not assign
this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,
without Couchbase's prior written consent.  Any attempt to assign this
Agreement without such consent will be null and of no effect.  Subject to
the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each
party's successors and permitted assigns.  If for any reason a court of
competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or
unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the
maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Agreement
will remain in full force and effect.  The failure by either party to

future enforcement of that or any other provision.  All waivers must
be in writing and signed by both parties.  All notices permitted or
required under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered
in person, by confirmed facsimile, overnight courier service or mailed
by first class, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the

to have been given upon receipt.  This Agreement shall be governed by
the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflicts
of law rules.  The parties expressly agree that the UN Convention for
the International Sale of Goods will not apply.  Any legal action or
proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in
the federal or state courts located in Santa Clara County, California and
the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and
venue therein.  Any amendment or modification to this Agreement must be
in writing signed by both parties.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
agreements regarding the subject matter hereof.  It is expressly agreed
that Section 5 above shall apply in respect of any PO sent by Licensee
to Couchbase. Furthermore, no additional or conflicting terms set forth
on any other document shall have any force or effect and are hereby
rejected unless expressly agreed upon by the parties' duly authorized
representatives in writing. Each of the parties has caused this Agreement
to be executed by its duly authorized representatives as of the Agreement
Effective Date.   Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement
will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement
or otherwise.  The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors
and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership,
joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency between the parties.
Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations
on the other's behalf without the other's prior written consent.
Licensee has not relied on the availability of any future version of the
Software or any future product in making its decision to enter into this
Agreement.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one instrument. Signatures transmitted electronically
